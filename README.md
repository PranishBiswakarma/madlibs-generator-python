# Mad Libs Generator (Python)

This Python program reads a story template with placeholders marked by `<word>`, prompts the user to enter words corresponding to each placeholder, and then generates a complete story with the user’s input.

## How It Works

- Reads the story from `story.txt` that contains placeholders like `<noun>`, `<verb>`, etc.
- Searches and collects all unique placeholders in the story.
- Asks the user to input words for each placeholder.
- Replaces placeholders with user input to generate the final story.
- Prints the customized story to the console.

## What I Learned and Used

- File handling: reading a story template from a text file.
- String parsing and manipulation to find placeholders.
- Using `set` to track unique placeholders.
- Dictionary usage for storing user responses.
- Basic input and output for interactive CLI applications.
- Building dynamic content generation using user input.
